#### Welcome to my GitHub page! Here you can find projects I am currently working on, and snapshots of work I have done at [ONE Campaign](https://data.one.org/), [Home State Politics](https://homestatepolitics.org/), and the [Pardee Center](https://korbel.du.edu/pardee).

### About me

I am passionate about international affairs and data science - and you can usually find me at the intersection of these 2 fields. I currently work as a research analyst at ONE Campaign, actively contributing to policy analysis and data visualizations powering [data.one.org](https://data.one.org/), and developing Python tools to work with international development data.

I currently maintain 2 Python packages that help explore and analyze messy international development data - [bblocks](https://github.com/ONEcampaign/bblocks) contains tools to extract and manipulate international development data from a variety of sources, and tools to transform and analyze that data. [unesco_reader](https://github.com/lpicci96/unesco_reader) provides a pythonic way to extract and interact with UNESCO Institute of Statistics (UIS) data.

I also volunteer at [Home State Politics](https://homestatepolitics.org/), helping develop webscrapers to extract legislative voting and demographic data from US State legislatures. The non-profit hopes to promote civic engagement by making state legislative data easily accessible to anyone. 

I recently graduated from the Korbel School of International Studies at the University of Denver (2021), with an M.A. in Global Finance, Trade & Economic Integration.
My academic coursework and research have focused on areas including the politics of international trade and globalization, international financial regulation, and economic development, while largely applying quantitative methods to these areas. 

### A little more about me...

I am originally from Italy, I grew up in Zimbabwe, I studied in the United States, and now I live in France - I'm a born digital nomad. Like most data science geeks, I'm usually working on some side projects for fun. I sometimes dabble with the #TidyTuesday challenge because I love data viz (and the R community is great!). Other than data stuff I love playing tennis (and most sposrts in general) and cooking - I often help out at my [family's restaurant](https://www.instagram.com/aroma_caffe_167/?next=%2F) in Harare when I visit. Feel free to reach out over email, twitter, or on LinkedIn to chat or collaborate on fun projects!
