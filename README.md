Welcome to my GitHub page! I am a research analyst and data analyst at ONE Campaign, developing tools mostly in Python. I am passionate about international affairs and data science. I currently maintain 2 Python packages for working with international development data - [bblocks](https://github.com/ONEcampaign/bblocks) contains tools to extract and manipulate international development data, [unesco_reader](https://github.com/lpicci96/unesco_reader) contains tools to work with UNESCO Institute of Statistics (UIS) data.

Here you can find repositories with some of my personal projects as well as some snapshots of work I have done for [ONE Campaign](https://data.one.org/), [Home State Politics](https://homestatepolitics.org/), and the [Pardee Center](https://korbel.du.edu/pardee).
### About me

I currently work as a research analyst at [ONE Campaign](https://data.one.org/) focusing on research for development finance, data automation with Python, and data visualization. I also volunteer as a data engineer for [Home State Politics](https://homestatepolitics.org/), helping develop webscrapers for state legislative data. I graduated from the Korbel School of International Studies at the University of Denver, with an M.A. in Global Finance, Trade & Economic Integration. My academic coursework and research have focused on areas including the politics of international trade and globalization, international financial regulation, and economic development, while largely applying quantitative methods to these areas.
