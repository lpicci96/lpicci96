Welcome to my GitHub page! I am a research analyst and self taught data engineer and python developer. I am passionate about international affairs and especially about the intersection of the data science and international affairs fields. Here you can find some of my personal projects as well as some snapshots of work I have done for [ONE Campaign](https://www.one.org/), [Home State Politics](https://homestatepolitics.org/), and the [Pardee Center](https://korbel.du.edu/pardee), including visualizations, webscrapers, api tools for organizations such as UNESCO, statistical tools such as the trade complementarity index (TCI) calculator, and others. 

### About me

I currently work as a research analyst at [ONE Campaign](https://www.one.org/) focusing on research for development finance, data automation with Python, and data visualization. I also volunteer as a data engineer for [Home State Politics](https://homestatepolitics.org/), helping develop webscrapers for state legislative data. I graduated from the Korbel School of International Studies at the University of Denver, with an M.A. in Global Finance, Trade & Economic Integration. My academic coursework and research have focused on areas including the politics of international trade and globalization, international financial regulation, and economic development, while largely applying quantitative methods to these areas. I am originally from Italy, although I grew up in Zimbabwe. I am passionate about languages - I speak English and Italian, I spent a considerable amount of time studying French (part of which was spend working on a farm in Normandy), and I am learning Spanish and Portuguese. When I am not working on my own projects, I am working hard at my family's [restaurant](https://www.facebook.com/aromacaffeharare) in Harare.
